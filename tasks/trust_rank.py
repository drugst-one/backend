def trust_rank(task_hook: TaskHook):
    r"""Computes TrustRank.
    
    The TrustRank [1_] is a node centrality measure which scores nodes in a network 
    based on how well they are connected to a (trusted) set of seed nodes (in our case: 
    proteins selected for analysis). It is a variant of the PageRank, where the node 
    centraities are initialized by assigning uniform probabilities to all seeds and zero 
    probabilities to all non-seed nodes.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    strain_or_drugs : str
      The virus strain for which the analysis should be run, or the string literal "drugs"
      (if used for ranking drugs).
      
    seeds : list of str
      A list of UNIPROT IDs identifying the seed proteins.
      
    datasets : list of str
      List of datasets whose nodes and returned_edges should be considered for the analysis.
      If empty, all available datasets are employed.
      
    ignored_edge_types : list of str, optional (default: [])
      Edges whose types are contained in this list are ignored in the analysis.
      
    ignore_drug_non_seed_edges : bool, optional (default: False)
      If True, edges from non-seed host proteins to drugs are ignored when ranking drugs.
      
    include_non_approved_drugs : bool, optional (default: False)
      If True, also non-approved drugs are considered when ranking drugs.
      
    damping_factor : float, optional (default: 0.85)
      The employed damping factor (between 0 and 1). The larger the damping factor, 
      the faster the trust is propagated through the network.
      
    result_size : int, optional (default: 20)
      The number of new candidate proteins to be returned.
      
    num_threads : int, optional (default: 1)
      Number of threads. Requires that graph_tool is compiled with OpenMP support.
      Should not be exposed in the frontend.
      
    Returns
    -------
    results : {"networks": list of dict, "node_attributes": list of dict}
      "networks": A one-element list containing the subgraph induced by the result 
        proteins and the seeds, along with the maximal score of all nodes, the maximal
        score off all nodes except virus proteins, and the maximal scores of all nodes
        except seed nodes.
      "node_attributes": A one-element list containing a dictionary with the following 
        attributes for all nodes in the returned network:
        "node_types": The type of the nodes (either "virus", "host", or "drug").
        "is_seed": A flag that specifies whether the node is a seed.
        "scores": The un-normalized scores for all non-seed nodes (nan for the virus proteins).
      
    Notes
    -----
    Let :math:`S` be the number of seeds, :math:`d` be the selected damping factor, 
    and :math:`N^-(u)` and :math:`deg^+(u)` be, respectively, the set of in-neighbors 
    and the out-degree of a node :math:`u`. Then the TrustRank :math:`TR(s)` of a 
    seed :math:`s` is recursively defined as
    
    .. math::
        TR(s) = \frac{1-d}{S} + d \sum_{u\in N^-(s)}\frac{TR(u)}{deg^+(u)}\text{,}
    
    while the TrustRank :math:`TR(v)` of a non-seed node $v$ is defined as follows: 
    
    .. math::
        TR(v) = d \sum_{u\in N^-(v)}\frac{TR(u)}{deg^+(u)} 
     
    The algorithm iteratively evaluates these equations until convergence. For undirected 
    graphs, the set of in-neighbours :math:`N^-(u)` and the out-degree :math:`deg^+(u)` 
    are substituted by the set of neighbors :math:`N(u)` and the degree :math:`deg(u)`, 
    respectively.
    
    This implementation is based on graph-tool, a very efficient Python package for network
    analysis with C++ backend and multi-threading support. Installation instructions for graph-tool
    can be found at https://git.skewed.de/count0/graph-tool/-/wikis/installation-instructions.
